/**
 * The ZecBlock logotype: gold block + "Zec" in gold, "Block" in the theme's ink.
 *
 * Two supplied PNGs, pixel-aligned (both 422x98 with identical content
 * bounds), stacked and cross-faded by CSS. That replaces the previous
 * single-artwork-plus-gradient-mask approach, which had to encode the
 * logotype's color boundaries as hardcoded gradient stops and re-measuring
 * them by hand every time the artwork changed. Swapping by CSS variable
 * rather than by reading the theme in JS keeps it correct during SSR and
 * avoids a hydration mismatch or a flash of the wrong variant.
 *
 * `tone` forces a variant regardless of theme, for the press-kit previews
 * that show both on one page.
